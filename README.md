## Text Classification https://github.com/ziranmin/NLP-Text-Classification\
By collecting features from words in sentences, I built a machine learning classifier that can classify whether a word in a sentence is complex or simple with accuracy (F1-score) higher than 0.8 which reached class top 10 (with bonus points).
