# NLP-Projects

## Text Classification https://github.com/ziranmin/NLP-Text-Classification
By collecting features from words in sentences, I built a machine learning classifier that can classify whether a word in a sentence is complex or simple with accuracy (F1-score) higher than 0.8 which reached class top 10 (with bonus points). 

## Vector Space Model https://github.com/ziranmin/NLP-Vector-Space-Model
By manipulating 10-megabyte dataset, creating term-document matrix, and implementing similarities function (cosine, jaccard, dice) from scratch, I found the most similar characters and most emotionally-central play from the full corpus of Shakespeare’s 36 work.

## Recurrent Neural Network https://github.com/ziranmin/NLP-Recurrent-Neural-Network
I used Pytorch to build a Recurrent Neural Network which classified 27,000 city name by 9 countries with accuracy about 50%. I also built a character-level RNN to generate sentences from Donald Trump’s speech.

## Spanish Named Entity Recognition https://github.com/ziranmin/NLP-Spanish-Named-Entity-Recognition
Through exploring 14 features from words in sentences, I implemented a Name Entity Recognition System with conditional random field model to classify name entities in Spanish corpus with accuracy (F1-score) of 74.77%.

## Twitter Emoji Prediction https://github.com/ziranmin/NLP-Twitter-Emoji-Prediction
By using word embedding methods (TF-IDF vectorization and Word2Vec), I build machine learning classifiers that can predict the most possibly associated emoji in a tweet based on 90,000 English tweets and 19,000 Spanish tweets.
